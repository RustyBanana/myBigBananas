This is where we input what we plan and where to put stuff.


Structs :
    _color {
      unsigned char red,
      unsigned char blue,
      unsigned char green}
    _position {double x, double y}
    _complex{double a, double b}

Generating set --->

_position pixelPosition(_position pixelPos, int zoom, int col, int row)
int escapeSteps(_position)
_complex squareComplex(_complex)
Double modulus(_complex)

Printing the set --->
supplied to us in bmpserver file. Editting the serveBMP function to produce an arry and then write to server.
unsigned char stepsToRed (int steps);
unsigned char stepsToBlue (int steps);
unsigned char stepsToGreen (int steps);

Testing the function (if required) --->
print out mandelbrot set with * and space characters
